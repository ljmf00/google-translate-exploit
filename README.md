# Google Translate - Translation Exploit
Vulnerabilities in translation algorithm that leaks some weird data.

----------

## Description
Basically this exploit breaks Google Translate service using `by` word with an `id` (number typed) and a few keywords like `people`, `downloads`, `posts`, `message`, etc...

## Example of reproduction
1. Open https://translate.google.com/
2. Choose Portuguese as the source language and other language for the translation language.
3. Try to translate `por 134089712349811241234 downloads`.
4. Check out your weird translation! (you can change the number to change the database query)

## Formal Report
At this point, I got no official contact from Google. I already reported this issue on Google Issue Tracker (`#119504713` on `Tue, 13 Nov 2018, 20:27`) but the issue was marked as `Intended Behavior`.
