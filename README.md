Vulnerabilities in translation algorithm that leaks some weird data.

----------

## Description
Basically this exploit breaks Google Translate service using `por`, (`by` in english) word with an `id` (number typed) and a few keywords like `people`, `downloads`, `posts`, `message`, etc...

This suspected to be a Query/[Code Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection) exploit that interact, apparently, with Google Maps, Youtube, Blogger, Google Play,... databases that leaks non-indexed information by the search engines, so it could be private information.

## Example of reproduction
1. Open https://translate.google.com/
2. Choose Portuguese as the source language and other language for the translation language.
3. Try to translate `por 3232312231236872122321344 message`.
4. Check out your weird translation! (you can change the number to change the database query)

### Advanced queries
This could be scalable with `AND` keywords, `;`, middle text on the number or even negative numbers at the end afects the result.
Examples:
- `por 11141566661212131314689999312345797365 downloads AND por 11141566661212131314689999312345797365 downloadspor 11141566661212131314689999312345797365 -23467`
- `por 11141566661212131314689999312345797365 downloads AND; por 111415666612345212131314asdf689999312345797365 downloads -234672345234523452345`
- `por 111415666612345212131314asdf689999312345797365 downloads -234672345234523452345`
